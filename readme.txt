Docker Architecture
===================
  The docker containers are managed in a layered approach hence reducing the footprints of the images with shareable applications.
  Eg: Sharing HTTP server in two webapps.

  Traditionally Ubuntu was being used as the defacto OS 
  Docker suggested OS: Alpine Linux: https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/ (small 5MB footprint)  //docker is being used beyond enterprises in IoT devices etc.

  Thin Writeable layer
  --------------------


Docker Run
===========
    D/C need to be run as daemons.


Docker orchestration
====================
