Volumes + Docker
    * We attach a volume to a container. Path qualifies as Local or Host.
        - docker volume ls (shows the available volumes)
            > docker volume create <name> //dbdata -> This created in the local host in the ...lib/docker/volume folder
            > docker run -d -v dbdata:/opt  -> Attaching the volume to the container.

    * Volume Driver
        - Local driver does not allow access over n/w.
            Possible solution is to create a n/w storage and mount on all containers. NOT recommended as this is heavy.
        - Instead use --
            > docker plugin ls (tells if plugin support is available)
            > RexRay - Docker plugin by EMC - user Amazon EBS plugin
